"Classes_Intro" "Classes Information"
"Classes_Core" "The 'base class' is just the theoretical foundation that all classes are based on. All classes(including subclasses) have the same base armor and health/energy but different attributes per tier causing the health/energy and armor to be different. The math behind this is every class starts with 192 health/energy but it is increased by 8 per skill point in strength/intelligence respectively. Armor is increased by 1 per 10 agility and movement speed is 5 per agility but the base varies between classes and subclasses. Each class shares the same subclass system and several base skills.<br><br>
